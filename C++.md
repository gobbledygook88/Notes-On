# Notes On: C++

## Introduction
The following document is a record of useful pointers and tips as I learn the C++ programming language. The style is concise and straight to the point, with many basic aspects missing. This is meant for programmers who know another language, so to act as a tip sheet for future reference. There is an emphasis on syntax, differences and best practices.

A variety of sources are, and will be used, as I continually update this document. See the Bibliography section for a full list.

    Beware! If you are a seasoned programmer in C++, quickly `cmd + w` your way out of here. 
    I'm very sure you will find lots of mistakes and inaccuracies, things which aren't strictly true, 
    or are just plain wrong. Save yourselves!

## Installation
We will be using the `g++` compiler throughout
