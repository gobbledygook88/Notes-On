# Common Problems and Solution Methodologies

## Closest Pair Problems
Given a set of n points on a plane, determine the pair of points which are closest together (via Euclidean distance).

## Convex Hull
Given a set X of points on the plane, determine the smallest convex set that contains X.

## Assignment Problem
There are a number of agents and a number of tasks. Any agent can be assigned to any task, incurring some cost depending on said task assignment. All tasks must be allocated exactly one agent. We wish to minimise the total cost of the collective assignments.

## Rod Cutting Problem
We are given a rod of fixed length. We wish to determine the sub-lengths in which to divide the rod in order to maximise profit. Each length is given a profit cost.

## Change Making Problem
Given a set denomination of currency, determine the minimum number of coins (and their values) required to total a given value.

## Activity Scheduling Problem
Given a set of activities with their begin and end times, we wish to maximise the number of activities to occur subject to time and resource constraints, with no collisions (overlaps).

## String Matching
Given a text and a pattern, we wish to find (all) locations where the pattern exists within the text.

## Connected Components
Determine the connected components of an undirected graph.

## Minimum Spanning Trees
Given a connected, undirected graph, find a spanning tree with minimum total weight.

## Single Source Shortest Distance
Given a weighted graph and a single vertex, find the shortest paths to all other vertices.

## All Pairs Shortest Distance
Given a weighted graph, find the shortest distance from all vertices to all other vertices.

## Max-Flow
Given a weighted graph, find the maximum capacity of flow for each edge from a source vertex to a target vertex.

## Travelling Salesman Problem
Given a weighted graph, and a starting vertex, find the shortest path (route) through all other vertices and ending at the original vertex.

## Knapsack Problem
Given a set of items, each with a weight and value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and total value is as large as possible.

## Subset Sum Problem
Given a set of integers, attempt to find a non-empty subset whose sum is zero.
